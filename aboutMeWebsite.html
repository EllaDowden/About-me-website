          I am a 23 year old, recent Psychology graduate from London. The main
          focus of my degree were developmental and clinical psychology. I love
          working with children and understanding how their brains and
          behaviours develop! I wrote my final dissertation on Reading
          comprehension in children with visual impairments.

          I also have a neurological sleep condition called Narcolepsy. This is
          caused by a deciciency of the main chemical that controls the
          sleep/wake cycle in the brain. The main symptoms include excessive
          daytime fatigue (similar to a neurotypical person being sleep
          depreived for upto 48 hours!) and cataplexy. This has had a
          significant impact on my life over the past decade and is a large part
          of why I began my coding journey. I believe that a career in tech may
          be more accessible for my disability due to the freedom to work
          remotely!

          I began my coding journey this autumn as a way of passing the time on
          medical leave. But I quickly discovered how much I enjoyed learning
          this new skill. Being able to express my creativity in a new way has
          been both cathartic and exciting for me so I sought out to find an
          apprentiship that could help me learn even more! Luckily I stumbled
          across Coders and Founders on tiktok. My expereience attending their
          pre-appication coding meetings was better then I could've hoped for
          and solidified my goal to apply for their skills bootcamp! The heplful
          and friendly atmosphere really encouraged me to keep working towards
          that goal.

        I am Applying for Foudners and Coders for a number of different reasons.
        I've spent the past year on medical leave due to my condition and
        decided to take up coding as a new hobby this summer. I had perviously
        never thought I could become good enough to utilize it in my career.
